# AdventOfCode2025
Advent of Code 2025 master repo! Merry Christmas, and let's enjoy the challenges!

I think i'm going to do this set of challenges twice - mostly: once in a language that is easy / I know..... maybe Python, maybe JavaScript, maybe Go...... and then a second time to learn / reinforce a language that I either don't know or that could use a bit better feel-good (looking at you, C# ðŸ˜©)
